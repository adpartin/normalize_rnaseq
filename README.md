# Batch effect removal from RNA-Seq

Technological advances in methodologies for genomic profiling lead researchers to generate large databases of expression data to better understand cancer and advance treatment discovery. Researchers exploit machine learning algorithms to learn predictive patterns in these datasets. The ability of models to generalize is often proportional to the sample size that the models are trained on. Therefore, scientists are often tempted to integrate datasets from multiple sources in order to enhance the learning capabilities of machine learning algorithms. We discovered a strong batch-effect in our exploratory data analysis of four cancer datasets. Batch-effect often refers to a signal (information) in data that is caused not due to the biological signal of interest. Ignoring batch-effect may lead to false conclusions and unexpected results in downstream activities. The figure shows plots of principal component analysis before and after the removal of the batch effects using the ComBat algorithm. In this case, four data sources are aggregated into a single dataset: GDC (human samples), CCLE (cell lines), NCI-60 (cell lines), NCI-PDM (patient-derived xenografts). PCA of raw expression data reveals that NCI-60 and NCI-PDM are more similar than NCI-60 and CCLE. This suggests that the strongest signal in data is not due to the tissue types but rather the facility that sequenced the samples. Removing batch-effect removal mitigates this difference.
